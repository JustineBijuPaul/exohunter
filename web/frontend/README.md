# ExoHunter Frontend

React-based frontend for the ExoHunter exoplanet classification system.

## Features

- üìÅ **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop CSV file upload with support for tabular features and light curve data
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Manual Entry**: Form-based input for exoplanet features and light curve time series
- üîÆ **Predictions**: Real-time classification with confidence levels and probability distributions
- üìà **Visualizations**: Interactive Plotly.js charts for light curve data
- üé® **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout with modern UI/UX
- ‚ö° **Real-time API**: Live connection to FastAPI backend with health monitoring

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd web/frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open in browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## API Integration

The frontend automatically connects to the FastAPI backend running on `http://localhost:8000`. The proxy is configured in `vite.config.js` to route `/api/*` requests to the backend.

### Supported Data Formats

**Tabular Features CSV:**
```csv
period,radius,temperature,magnitude,snr,duration,depth,impact
2.47,1.2,5800,12.3,15.2,3.1,0.01,0.5
```

**Light Curve CSV:**
```csv
time,flux
0.0,1.000
