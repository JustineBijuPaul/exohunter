### Confusion Matrix

```
                    Predicted
                    CANDIDATE  CONFIRMED  FALSE POSITIVE
True CANDIDATE           11         0            8
True CONFIRMED            0         0            0
True FALSE POSITIVE      18         1           63
```

### Key Observations:
- ‚úÖ **Excellent at detecting FALSE POSITIVES**: 88.73% precision, 76.83% recall
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Moderate CANDIDATE detection**: 57.89% recall but only 37.93% precision (high false positive rate)
- ‚ùå **No CONFIRMED samples in test set**: Cannot evaluate CONFIRMED class performance
- üéØ **Overall**: Model is very good at rejecting false positives but tends to misclassify some false positives as candidates

## ü§ñ Individual Model Performance

| Model | Accuracy | F1-Score | Notes |
|-------|----------|----------|-------|
| **XGBoost** | 78.22% | 77.20% | üèÜ Best individual model |
| **LightGBM** | 71.29% | 73.87% | Strong performer |
| **CatBoost** | 41.58% | 50.97% | Underperforming |
| **Random Forest** | 63.37% | 65.40% | Moderate |
| **Extra Trees** | 58.42% | 64.30% | Moderate |
| **Deep NN** | 18.81% | 5.96% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Very poor - needs investigation |

### Analysis:
- **XGBoost** significantly outperforms the ensemble (78.22% vs 73.27%)
- **Deep NN** is dragging down ensemble performance - consider excluding it
- Tree-based models (XGBoost, LightGBM, RF) are most reliable
- **Recommendation**: Use XGBoost alone or create weighted ensemble favoring tree models

## üîÆ Prediction Distribution

| Predicted Class | Count | Percentage |
|----------------|-------|------------|
| **FALSE POSITIVE** | 71 | 70.30% |
| **CANDIDATE** | 29 | 28.71% |
| **CONFIRMED** | 1 | 0.99% |

**True Distribution:**
- FALSE POSITIVE: 82 (81.19%)
- CANDIDATE: 19 (18.81%)
- CONFIRMED: 0 (0.00%)

---

## üìâ Confidence Analysis

- **Average Confidence**: 55.52%
- **Min Confidence**: 38.01%
- **Max Confidence**: 88.09%

The moderate average confidence (55.52%) suggests the model is appropriately uncertain about many predictions, which is good for a conservative classifier.

## üéØ Comparison to Training Results

| Metric | Training (exoplanets_combined.csv) | Test (test.csv) | Delta |
|--------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Accuracy** | 77.11% | 73.27% | -3.84% |
| **F1-Score** | 77.10% | 75.48% | -1.62% |

The model shows **minimal overfitting** with only a 3.84% drop in accuracy on the test set. This indicates good generalization.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

1. **No CONFIRMED samples in test set**: Unable to validate CONFIRMED class predictions
2. **Deep NN underperforming**: 18.81% accuracy indicates the neural network failed to learn effectively from tabular data
3. **Class imbalance**: Test set is heavily skewed toward FALSE POSITIVE (81%), which may bias results
4. **Some misclassifications**: 18 false positives predicted as candidates (21.9% of false positives)

---

## üí° Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Remove Deep NN from ensemble** - It's causing more harm than good (18.81% accuracy)
2. **Use XGBoost directly** - Best single model at 78.22% accuracy
3. **Create weighted ensemble** - Give more weight to XGBoost and LightGBM

### Model Improvements:
1. **Hyperparameter tuning** - Especially for CatBoost (41.58% is too low)
2. **Feature selection** - Reduce 94 features to most important 50-60
3. **Threshold tuning** - Adjust classification threshold for better CANDIDATE recall
4. **Cost-sensitive learning** - Penalize false negatives for CANDIDATEs more heavily

### Validation:
1. **Get more CONFIRMED samples** - Test set needs better class representation
2. **Cross-validation** - Perform 5-fold CV on combined dataset
3. **Stratified sampling** - Ensure test sets have balanced class distribution

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Retrain without Deep NN**: Create `ensemble_v2` excluding the neural network
2. **Hyperparameter optimization**: Use Optuna or GridSearchCV on tree models
3. **Feature importance analysis**: Identify and visualize top 20 most important features
4. **API deployment**: Integrate the model into the FastAPI endpoint
5. **Streamlit dashboard**: Add test predictions visualization to web interface

## üìù Conclusion

The ultimate ensemble model achieves **73.27% accuracy** on the test set with strong performance in detecting false positives (88.73% precision). However:

- ‚úÖ Model generalizes well (minimal overfitting)
- ‚úÖ Excellent at rejecting false positives
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate at identifying candidates
- ‚ùå Deep NN component needs to be removed
- ‚ùå CatBoost needs retraining

**Overall Grade**: **B** (Good but room for improvement)

The model is production-ready for **conservative exoplanet screening** where rejecting false positives is critical. For applications requiring high candidate recall, further tuning is recommended.
